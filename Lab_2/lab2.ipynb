    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "## Short summary\n",
    "In this exercise you will: \n",
    "\n",
    "* train multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for both binary and multiple classification problems and a regression problem, and perform model selection to optimize validation performance\n",
    "\n",
    "You should write the report of the exercise within this notebook. The details of how to do that can be found below in section \"Writing the report\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline for submitting the report: See Canvas assignment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data\n",
    "There are several datasets in this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "### syn2\n",
    "The *syn2* dataset represents a binary classification problem. The input data is 2D which allows for an easy visual inspection of the different classes and the decision boundary implemented by the network. The dataset is generated using random numbers each time you run the cell. This means that each time you generate the data it will be slightly different. You can control this by having a fixed *seed* to the random number generator. The cell \"PlotData\" will plot the *syn2* dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This is the same dataset as in exercise 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### regr2\n",
    "There *regr2* dataset represents a more complex synthetic regression problem than *regr1* from exercise 1. It has 6 inputs (independent variables) and one target variable (dependent variable). It is generated according to the following formula:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad d = 2x_1 + x_2x_3^2 + e^{x_4} + 5x_5x_6 + 3\\sin(2\\pi x_6) + \\alpha\\epsilon$  \n",
    "    \n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is added normally distributed noise and $\\alpha$ is a parameter controlling the size of the added noise. Variables $x_1,...,x_4$ are normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance, whereas $x_5, x_6$ are uniformly distributed ($[0,1]$). The target value $d$ has a non-linear dependence on ***x***.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spiral data\n",
    "This is the \"famous\" spiral dataset that consists of two 2-D spirals, one for each class. The perfect classification boundary is also a spiral. The cell \"PlotData\" will plot this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Japanese vowels dataset\n",
    "*This data set is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Japanese+Vowels* In short, nine male speakers uttered two Japanese vowels /ae/ successively. For each utterance, a discrete times series was produced where each time point consists of 12 (LPC cepstrum) coefficients. The length of each time series was between 7-29. \n",
    "Here we treat each point of the time series as a feature (12 inputs). In total we have 9961\n",
    "data points which then has been divided into 4274 for training, 2275 for validation and 3412 for test. The original data files are provided as *ae.train* and *ae.test*. The task is now based on a single sample value of one of the speakers, determine which speaker it was. This is, in summary, a 9-class classification problem with 12 input values for each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bioconcentration dataset\n",
    "*This data set is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/QSAR+Bioconcentration+classes+dataset* In short, this is a dataset of manually-curated bioconcentration factors (BCF) for 779 chemicals used to determine the mechanisms of bioconcentration, i.e. to predict whether a chemical: (1) is mainly stored within lipid tissues, (2) has additional storage sites (e.g. proteins), or (3) is metabolized/eliminated. Data were randomly split into a training set of 584 compounds (75%) and a test set of 195 compounds (25%), preserving the proportion between the classes. The independent variables consist of 9 molecular descriptors. This is, in summary, a 3-class classification problem with 9 input values for each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The exercises\n",
    "There are 10 questions in this exercise, in five different cells below. \n",
    "\n",
    "For questions 1-6, code is available that you can run directly or only need to make small modifications to. The first 3 questions deal with 2D binary classification problems. Here you will be able to see the boundary implemented by the different MLPs that you train. Questions 4-6 deal with training a regression network for the *regr2* dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For questions 7-10 we only provide parts of the code and you should add the rest. However, it is typically just a matter of paste and copy from the previous code cells (in a proper way). Question 7-8 deals with Japanese vowels classification problem; here your task is to come up with a model that optimizes the validation result. Question 9 is about the Bioconcentration dataset, and again you should come up with a good model. Finally, the last question is to find a model that can solve the spiral problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The different 'Cells'\n",
    "This notebook contains several cells with python code, together with the markdown cells (like this one) with only text. Each of the cells with python code has a \"header\" markdown cell with information about the code. The table below provides a short overview of the code cells. \n",

    "In order for you to start with the exercise you need to run all cells with the celltype \"Needed\". The very first time you start with this exercise we suggest that you enter each of the needed cells, read the cell instruction and run the cell. It is important that you do this in the correct order, starting from the top and work you way down the cells. Later when you have started to work with the notebook it may be easier to use the command \"Run All\" or \"Run all above\" found in the \"Cell\" dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing the report\n",
    "First the report should be written within this notebook. We have prepared the last cell in this notebook for you where you should write the report. The report should contain 4 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Name:\n",
    "* Introduction: A **few** sentences where you give a short introduction to the content and purpose of the exercise.\n",
    "* Answers to questions: For each of the questions provide an answer. It can be short answers or longer ones depending on the nature of the questions, but try to be efficient in your writing. (Don't include lots of program output or plots that aren't central to answering the question.)\n",
    "* Conclusion: Summarize your findings in a few sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you write the report in this last cell and **not** after each question! \n",

    "From now on we will talk about *performance*! It can be performance of a trained model on the training dataset or the performance on the validation dataset. What do we mean by performance? For classification problems we will provide 4 different measurements as printed by the *stats_classification* function. They are:\n",

Since the *Adam* method is usually better than the vanilla *stochastic gradient descent*, it is used in the cells below as the default minimizer. \n",

    "Now we are going to look at a regression problem. The data as described above (*regr2*) consists of 6 inputs (features) and one output (target) value. As in the previous exercise, a new data set is generated each time you call the *regr2* function. To get exactly the same data set between different calls, use a fixed seed. For this problem we can control the amount of noise added to the target value. We are going to use a relatively small training dataset (250) and a larger validation dataset (1000) to get a more robust estimation of the generalization performance, and 0.4 units of noise. For regression problems we also need new performance measures. The *stats_reg* function will give you two such measures:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Hint:** A good strategy is to start with a \"small\" model and increase the number of hidden nodes and monitor the validation result.\n",

    "## Question 5, improving generalization with L2 regularization\n",
    "*Model selection based on L2 (weight decay).* Instead of using the number of hidden nodes to control the complexity we can use a regularization term added to the error function. You are going to control the complexity by adding a *L2* regularizer (see the \"INPUT\" dictionary in the cell). For the L2 regularization to make sense we need a start model that is capable being overtrained. The suggestion is to use at least twice as many hidden nodes for this question compared to what you found in Q4. You should modify the *L2* value until you find the optimal validation performance. **(a) Present your optimal model (L2 value and number of hidden nodes) and the validation performance.** **(b) Do you obtain a better result compared to Q4?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** When you test different values for a hyperparameter, it usually makes more sense to multiply with a constant factor than to add a constant term. For example, if you test five values in the range from 0.1 to 10, the values {0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10} are usually a better choice than {0.1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10}.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6, improving generalization with dropout\n",
    "*Model selection based on dropout.* Instead of using the *L2* regularizer we can use dropout. In short, repeat Q5, but use the *dropout* parameter instead. **(a) Present your optimal model (dropout value and number of hidden nodes) and the validation performance.** **(b) Do you obtain a better result compared to Q4/Q5?** \n",

In the training data there is: class 1: 345 cases, class 2: 48 cases, and class 3: 191 cases. One can end upp with situations that the network does not at all learn how to detect cases of class 2. **(b) What performance measure(s) do you think is(are) relevant when you select the optimal model for this problem?**  \n",
